Suzana Binte Sharif ,Susu,8,"I got countless memories with her. It's hard to pick one even so the journey we had while going school or batch by public transport,  mini picnic on her rooftop, Rajjak sir's batch will always hold a special part in my heart. Honestly every moment was so magical and full of enjoyment with her at that time. "
Jemima,Islam,10,"I have known sami for more than 10 years now for sure. But we did become friends later on. We became friends on a random day when we unintentionally sit next to each other and talked about our crushes ?! I didn‚Äôt really had very much thing in common with her but i did love her personality a lot. I still do now! She‚Äôs bold, she‚Äôs strong, she‚Äôs such a badass character i always felt inspired to. A part of me wanted to be her. But ig not everyone can be that cool, strong & bold. I still love everything about her and the woman she‚Äôs becoming with all her experiences in life. Her struggle scars makes her even more prettier & beautiful."
